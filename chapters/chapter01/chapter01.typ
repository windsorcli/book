= Introduction to Windsor CLI

Modern cloud-native development presents a paradox: while the tools available to us are more powerful than ever, the complexity of coordinating them has grown exponentially. Developers juggle multiple cloud providers, each with their own CLIs and authentication mechanisms. Infrastructure teams manage IaC configurations across dozens of environments. Operations teams reconcile differences between local development setups and production deployments. Platform engineers struggle to provide consistent tooling across diverse teams and projects.

Windsor CLI addresses this complexity head-on by providing a unified interface that orchestrates the cloud-native tool ecosystem. Rather than replacing these tools, Windsor acts as an intelligent coordinator, managing their configurations, credentials, and interactions in a way that feels natural and consistent across all environments.

== The Problem Windsor Solves

The modern cloud-native ecosystem, while powerful, has introduced significant operational complexity that affects every aspect of the development lifecycle. This complexity manifests in three primary areas that Windsor specifically addresses.

=== Context Switching Overhead
#index("context switching")
Consider a typical development workflow: a developer needs to work on a feature that spans multiple environments. They might start with local development using Docker Desktop, deploy to a staging cluster in a development AWS account, and finally promote their changes through a CI/CD pipeline that deploys to a production cluster in a separate production AWS account. Each environment requires:

- Different authentication mechanisms
- Environment-specific configuration files
- Platform-specific CLI tools
- Unique secrets and credentials
- Varying infrastructure configurations

The mental overhead of managing these differences is substantial. Developers spend time configuring tools rather than building features. Worse, the complexity leads to errors: production deployments with staging configurations, local development that doesn't match production behavior, and security vulnerabilities from mismanaged credentials.

This context switching problem compounds as teams grow and adopt more sophisticated deployment patterns. A single feature might touch local development, feature branch environments, staging, pre-production, and multiple production environments across different regions or cloud providers. Each context switch requires developers to mentally map the appropriate configurations, credentials, and deployment procedures.

=== Infrastructure Fragmentation
#index("infrastructure fragmentation")
Infrastructure-as-code tools have solved many deployment challenges, but they've also created new ones. Teams often end up with:

- Duplicated IaC modules across environments
- Inconsistent variable naming and structure
- Complex dependency management between modules
- Manual coordination of infrastructure updates
- Difficult-to-maintain environment-specific configurations

This fragmentation occurs because traditional infrastructure-as-code approaches focus on individual environments rather than the relationships between them. Teams create separate IaC configurations for each environment, leading to drift over time as environments evolve independently. Configuration management becomes increasingly complex as the number of environments grows, and ensuring consistency across environments requires significant manual effort.

The lack of standardization also affects team productivity. New team members must learn environment-specific configurations and deployment procedures. Knowledge becomes siloed among team members who specialize in particular environments, creating bottlenecks and single points of failure.

=== Tool Integration Complexity
#index("tool integration")
The cloud-native landscape includes dozens of specialized tools, each excellent at their specific function but challenging to integrate. Teams spend significant time building glue code and automation to connect:

- Container runtimes and orchestration platforms
- Secret management systems and application configurations
- CI/CD pipelines and deployment targets
- Monitoring systems and application metrics
- Development environments and production infrastructure

Each tool integration requires understanding multiple APIs, configuration formats, and operational models. Teams often build custom scripts and automation to bridge these gaps, creating technical debt and maintenance overhead. These integrations are brittle and require ongoing maintenance as tools evolve and teams adopt new technologies.

== Windsor's Solution: Unified Cloud-Native Development

Windsor CLI is a command-line interface that unifies cloud-native development workflows through several core capabilities that work together to eliminate the complexity described above.

=== Contextual Environment Management
#index("contexts")
#index("environment management")
Windsor introduces the concept of "contexts"—named environments that encapsulate all the configuration, credentials, and infrastructure definitions needed for a specific deployment target. Whether you're working on `local`, `staging`, or `production`, Windsor automatically configures your tools and environment variables to match your current context.

This contextual approach eliminates the cognitive overhead of remembering environment-specific configurations. When you switch to the `production` context, Windsor automatically configures your `kubectl` to point to the production cluster, sets the appropriate AWS credentials, and ensures all tools are configured consistently. The same commands work identically across all environments, reducing errors and improving developer productivity.

=== Blueprint-Driven Infrastructure
#index("blueprints")
At the heart of Windsor is the blueprint system—a declarative approach to defining infrastructure that spans multiple tools and platforms. Blueprints reference collections of IaC modules and Kubernetes configurations, creating a single source of truth for your infrastructure definition.

Unlike traditional infrastructure-as-code approaches that treat each environment independently, Windsor blueprints define the complete infrastructure pattern once and parameterize it for different environments. This approach ensures consistency across environments while allowing for environment-specific customization where necessary.

Blueprints also encode dependency relationships between infrastructure components, ensuring that resources are created in the correct order and dependencies are properly managed. This eliminates the manual coordination required when managing complex infrastructure deployments.

=== Blueprint Packaging and Sharing
#index("blueprint packaging")
#index("OCI registries")
Windsor's blueprint system extends beyond local definitions to include packaging and distribution capabilities. Teams can create reusable blueprint packages that encapsulate complete infrastructure patterns, making them shareable across projects and organizations.

Blueprint packages are distributed through OCI-compatible registries, leveraging the same infrastructure used for container images. This approach provides:

- *Version Management*: Semantic versioning for blueprint packages
- *Secure Distribution*: Authentication and authorization through existing registry infrastructure
- *Dependency Resolution*: Automatic resolution of blueprint dependencies
- *Immutable Artifacts*: Cryptographically signed blueprint packages

Teams can publish their tested infrastructure patterns using `windsor push`, making them available for reuse across projects. Other teams can then install these blueprints using `windsor install --blueprint`, immediately benefiting from proven infrastructure patterns without recreating them from scratch.

This packaging system creates a marketplace effect where teams can share infrastructure patterns, reducing duplication and improving consistency across organizations. Common patterns like "web application with monitoring" or "microservices with service mesh" can be packaged once and reused across multiple projects.

=== Intelligent Tool Orchestration
#index("tool orchestration")
Windsor doesn't replace your existing tools; it orchestrates them. When you run `windsor up` locally, Windsor:

- Configures your Docker daemon and Kubernetes context
- Sets appropriate environment variables for your cloud provider (AWS, Azure, etc.)
- Executes IaC plans in the correct order with proper dependency management
- Applies Kubernetes configurations through GitOps workflows
- Manages secrets and credentials securely across all tools

This orchestration layer abstracts away the complexity of tool integration while preserving the power and flexibility of the underlying tools. Teams can continue using their preferred tools and workflows while benefiting from Windsor's coordination and consistency.

=== Local Cloud Simulation
#index("local development")
One of Windsor's most powerful features is its ability to create complete cloud environments on your local machine. Using Docker and Kubernetes, Windsor can simulate complex multi-service architectures, allowing development and testing without cloud dependencies.

Local cloud simulation addresses the "works on my machine" problem by ensuring that local development environments closely mirror production deployments. This capability enables full-stack development without cloud costs and provides consistent environments for all team members regardless of their local setup.

=== Low-Dependency Bootstrapping
#index("bootstrapping")
Windsor is designed for immediate deployment capability with minimal setup requirements. The same Windsor workflow that runs locally can deploy directly to bare metal servers, cloud service providers, or execute within any CI/CD pipeline without modification.

This low-dependency approach means teams can start deploying infrastructure immediately after installing Windsor, without complex bootstrapping processes or extensive prerequisite installations. Whether you're deploying to a local development environment, a spare laptop, AWS, Azure, or running in GitHub Actions, the same `windsor up` command works consistently across all targets.

Strategically, Windsor represents a "platform-as-a-codebase" approach rather than traditional "platform-as-a-service" solutions. Teams own their complete infrastructure stack without being locked into proprietary platforms or requiring intermediate PaaS providers. This direct-to-infrastructure model provides complete control and transparency while maintaining the simplicity and consistency that teams expect from modern platform solutions.

The uniform deployment model eliminates the traditional friction between development and production environments, enabling teams to move seamlessly from local development to production deployment using identical tooling and processes.

== Core Concepts and Architecture

Understanding Windsor requires familiarity with several key concepts that work together to provide its unified experience. These concepts form the foundation of Windsor's approach to cloud-native development.

=== Contexts: Environment Abstraction
#index("contexts")
A context represents a complete environment configuration. When you switch contexts, Windsor reconfigures your entire toolchain to match that environment's requirements. This includes:

- Cloud provider credentials and configurations
- Kubernetes cluster connections
- Container registry settings
- DNS and networking configurations
- Secret and certificate management

Contexts are stored in the `contexts/` directory of your project, with each subdirectory representing a different environment:

```
contexts/
├── local/           # Local development environment
├── staging/         # Staging environment in AWS dev account
└── production/      # Production environment in AWS prod account
```

Each context directory contains a blueprint definition and any environment-specific configuration files. This structure provides a clear separation between environments while maintaining consistency in how they're defined and managed.

=== Blueprints: Infrastructure Definition
#index("blueprints")
Blueprints define the complete infrastructure and application stack for a context using a simple declarative format. Here's what a production blueprint looks like:

```yaml
kind: Blueprint
apiVersion: blueprints.windsorcli.dev/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: production
  description: Production environment infrastructure
sources:
- name: core
  url: oci://ghcr.io/windsorcli/core:v0.4.0
terraform:
- source: core
  path: network/aws-vpc
- source: core
  path: cluster/aws-eks
- path: applications/web-app
kustomize:
- name: monitoring
  source: core
  path: observability
- name: web-app
  path: applications/web-app
```

This blueprint defines a production environment that includes networking infrastructure, a Kubernetes cluster, and application deployments. The same blueprint structure can be used across environments with different parameters and configurations.

=== Environment Injection and the Windsor Hook
#index("environment injection")
#index("shell hook")
Windsor dynamically configures your shell environment as you navigate your project. This "environment injection" ensures that tools like `kubectl`, IaC tools, and cloud CLIs are always configured for your current context. The system is aware of:

- Your current working directory
- Your active Windsor context
- Required environment variables for each tool
- Secure credential management

The Windsor hook is a shell integration that runs `windsor env` before each command prompt. This seamless integration means your environment is always up-to-date without manual intervention. The hook is lightweight and only activates in trusted Windsor projects, ensuring that it doesn't interfere with other development workflows.

== Operational Workflow and Benefits

Windsor's operation follows a predictable pattern that scales from local development to production deployment:

1. *Project Initialization*: `windsor init <context>` creates a new project or context with template configurations, or `windsor install --blueprint <package>` installs a pre-built blueprint package
2. *Environment Activation*: The Windsor hook or manual `windsor env` commands configure your shell
3. *Infrastructure Deployment*: `windsor up` deploys infrastructure according to your blueprint
4. *Application Deployment*: `windsor install` deploys applications to your infrastructure
5. *Development Workflow*: Normal development work with automatically configured tooling
6. *Blueprint Sharing*: `windsor push` publishes tested infrastructure patterns as reusable packages
7. *Environment Cleanup*: `windsor down` cleanly tears down infrastructure when needed

This workflow scales from local development environments to complex multi-cloud production deployments, with the same commands and patterns applying across all contexts. The consistency eliminates the need for environment-specific documentation and reduces the learning curve for new team members.

=== Transformative Benefits

Windsor's approach delivers several transformative benefits that compound over time:

*Reduced Cognitive Load*: By abstracting away tool-specific configurations, Windsor allows developers to focus on their applications rather than infrastructure complexity. The contextual environment management means you never need to remember which credentials or configurations to use for each environment.

*Improved Consistency*: Windsor's blueprint system ensures that infrastructure definitions are consistent across environments. Variables and configurations are managed centrally, reducing the drift that often occurs between development, staging, and production environments.

*Faster Onboarding*: New team members can become productive quickly with Windsor. A single `windsor init local` command creates a complete development environment with all necessary tools configured correctly. No more multi-day setup processes or environment-specific documentation.

*Enhanced Security*: Credential management is built into Windsor's design. Secrets are encrypted at rest, environment variables are automatically scoped to appropriate contexts, and tool configurations follow security best practices by default.

*Local Development Fidelity*: Windsor's local cloud simulation capabilities mean that local development environments closely mirror production deployments. This reduces the "works on my machine" problem and catches integration issues early in the development cycle.

*Blueprint Reusability*: The blueprint packaging system enables teams to share proven infrastructure patterns across projects and organizations. Instead of recreating infrastructure configurations from scratch, teams can install and customize existing blueprints, accelerating project setup and ensuring consistency across deployments.

These benefits create a compounding effect: as teams adopt Windsor's patterns, the overhead of managing multiple environments decreases, allowing more time for feature development and innovation. The blueprint sharing ecosystem further amplifies these benefits as organizations build libraries of reusable infrastructure patterns.

== System Requirements and Prerequisites

#index("system requirements")
Before exploring Windsor's capabilities in the hands-on lab, it's important to understand the system requirements and prerequisites for optimal performance.

=== System Requirements

Windsor is designed to run on modern development workstations with sufficient resources to support local cloud simulation. For optimal performance, your system should meet the following specifications:

- *CPU*: 8 cores (minimum 4 cores)
- *Memory*: 8GB RAM (minimum 4GB)
- *Storage*: 60GB free disk space (minimum 20GB)
- *Operating System*: Linux, macOS, or Windows

These requirements ensure that Windsor can effectively simulate cloud environments locally, including running Kubernetes clusters, container registries, and supporting services. Systems with fewer resources may experience slower performance or limitations in the number of services that can run simultaneously.

=== Prerequisites

#index("prerequisites")
Windsor requires several tools to function effectively:

*Required*:
- Docker (choose one):
  - Docker Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - Native Docker (Linux)
  - Colima (macOS alternative)
- Git

*Optional* (depending on your use case):
- Terraform/OpenTofu (if using infrastructure-as-code features)
- kubectl (if working with Kubernetes clusters)

*Recommended for Full Experience*:
- Bare metal target (a spare laptop or dedicated machine for testing bare-metal deployments)
- Cloud provider account (AWS or Azure) for exploring production-scale infrastructure patterns

Windsor can be installed through package managers like Homebrew or Chocolatey, or by downloading binaries directly from the GitHub releases page. The complete installation process and tool setup will be covered step-by-step in the upcoming lab exercises.

== Installation and Shell Integration

#index("installation")
#index("shell integration")
Install Windsor using your preferred method (Homebrew, Chocolatey, or direct download). See the official documentation for the latest instructions.

After installing Windsor, set up the shell hook to ensure your environment is always configured for the correct Windsor context:

*Bash* (`~/.bashrc`):
```sh
eval "$(windsor hook bash)"
```

*Zsh* (`~/.zshrc`):
```sh
eval "$(windsor hook zsh)"
```

*PowerShell* (profile script):
```powershell
Invoke-Expression (& windsor hook powershell)
```

Restart your terminal or source your profile to activate the hook.

The shell hook automatically injects Windsor environment variables and context when you enter a project directory. This ensures all Windsor commands and related tools (Docker, kubectl, etc.) operate with the correct configuration for your current project.

You can display the current Windsor context in your shell prompt for clarity:

*Zsh Example:*
```zsh
PS1='%F{82}${WINDSOR_CONTEXT:+[$WINDSOR_CONTEXT] }%f'$PS1
```

*Bash Example:*
```bash
PS1='\[\e[32m\]${WINDSOR_CONTEXT:+[${WINDSOR_CONTEXT}] }\[\e[0m\]'$PS1
```

*PowerShell Example:*
```powershell
function prompt {
  if ($env:WINDSOR_CONTEXT) {
    Write-Host "[$env:WINDSOR_CONTEXT] " -NoNewline -ForegroundColor Green
  }
  "PS " + $(Get-Location) + "> "
}
```

If the environment is not injected, ensure your shell profile is sourced and the hook code is present. To disable, remove the Windsor hook code from your shell profile.
